## 👋 Hi there!

**Conqerra** is an open-source geopolitical simulation game.

Inspired by the mechanics and social dynamics of *Rival Regions* (which we've been avid players of for nearly a decade), Conqerra reimagines the experience with a focus on transparency, community ownership, and long-term sustainability.

Our goal is to create a rich sandbox world where players can engage in politics, warfare, economics, and media—shaping the future of nations through diplomacy, conflict, and cooperation.

### 🧭 Vision

We believe in building games that are:
- 🌍 **Social-first**: player interaction is the core gameplay loop  
- 🧠 **Strategic and emergent**: complex systems, meaningful decisions  
- 🛠️ **Open and collaborative**: developed in the open, by the community  

---

### 🎓 Credits & Inspiration

We owe inspiration and gratitude to **Rival Regions**, whose innovative gameplay planted the seed for this project. Conqerra seeks to honor that legacy while creating something new and community-driven.

### 🚧 Status

This project is in **early planning and documentation** phase.  
We're currently:
- Reverse-engineering Rival Regions to catalog its mechanics
- Defining Conqerra’s product vision and gameplay goals
- Building a contributor-friendly roadmap
